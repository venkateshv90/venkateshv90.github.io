title: "Performance Analysis of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models"
excerpt: "This project explores both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the Seeds and Obesity datasets (UCI website). In the [supervised learning analysis](https://github.com/venkateshv90/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Supervised), KNN, SVM, and NN models were evaluated. It was found that while all models performed well on the simpler Seeds dataset, the more complex Obesity dataset highlighted SVMâ€™s superior performance. The study underscores how dataset complexity and feature structure impact model efficiency and accuracy. The [unsupervised learning component](https://github.com/venkateshv90/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Unsupervised) applied Expectation Maximization and k-Means clustering models to the two datasets. Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, ICA, RP) were also applied to effectively identify the underlying data structures. Notably, dimensionality reduction enhanced NN performance, and integrating clustering insights further refined model accuracy. These findings demonstrate the power of combining supervised and unsupervised approaches for comprehensive data analysis"

title: "Analyzing Team and Player Performance in the 2023 Cricket World Cup"
excerpt: "This [project](https://github.com/venkateshv90/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Cricket-World-Cup-2023) examines the performance of teams and players in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, focusing on key aspects such as batting and bowling statistics, wicket dismissal types, and venue impact. As one of the most prestigious international cricket tournaments, the World Cup brings together top teams from around the globe. The 2023 edition, hosted in India, featured ten teams competing across multiple venues. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing match outcomes, shedding light on team strategies and individual performances that shaped the tournament."
