<h3>Analyzing Team and Player Performance in the 2023 Cricket World Cup</h3> 
This project examines the performance of teams and players in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, focusing on key aspects such as batting and bowling statistics, wicket dismissal types, and venue impact. As one of the most prestigious international cricket tournaments, the World Cup brings together top teams from around the globe. The 2023 edition, hosted in India, featured ten teams competing across multiple venues. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing match outcomes, shedding light on team strategies and individual performances that shaped the tournament.

<h3>Performance analysis of supervised and unsupervised Machine learning models</h3>
In this project, I explored supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the Seeds and Obesity datasets (<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI website</a>). In the supervised learning analysis, I evaluated the performance of KNN, SVM, and NN. It was found that while all models performed well on the simpler Seeds dataset, the more complex Obesity dataset highlighted SVMâ€™s superior performance. The study underscores how dataset complexity and feature structure impact model efficiency and accuracy. In unsupervised learning analysis, I applied Expectation Maximization and k-Means clustering models to the two datasets. I also utilized three dimensionality reduction techniques, namely PCA, ICA, and RP, to understand the effectiveness of model performance on reduced datasets. Notably, dimensionality reduction enhanced NN performance, and integrating clustering insights further refined model accuracy. These findings demonstrate the power of combining supervised and unsupervised approaches for comprehensive data analysis.
