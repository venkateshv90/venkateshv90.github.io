## Hello world!
Welcome to my website. I am an engineering professional and passionate about technology applications in mechanical and materials engineering. My research interests are AI and Machine Learning in Mechanical Engineering, Data-driven Materials Characterization and Applied Mathematics.

## From curiosity to expertise
Since childhood, I have been fascinated by disassembling and assembling toys, which led me to pursue Mechanical Engineering at Anna University, Chennai. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in material properties, prompting me to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree at the National University of Singapore. There, I became intrigued by computational applications in mechanical engineering.

My career began as a researcher at Nanyang Technological University, where I applied simulation models to characterize the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. I then joined Rolls-Royce Singapore, developing material models to study the brittle mechanics of Ti alloy components. By integrating data analysis into these models, I enhanced their reliability in predicting material properties.
My professional journey took me to Australia, where I worked as a Senior Research Engineer at UNSW Sydney, focusing on advanced manufacturing of nanocomposites. I leveraged deep learning techniques to accurately model structure-property relationships, driving new materials development. Over time, my passion for technology and programming grew, leading me to the U.S., where I am currently pursuing the Master of Science program in Computer Science at Georgai Institute of Technology.



## ü§ñ Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to ... Reinforcement Learning. :SG: :us:

Moreover, I have published a paper at the some conference and in the some journal.

## üìú Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific .... .

## üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## üìö Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
